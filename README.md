# Overview

## Software Description

This is a C++-based calculator application with a graphical user interface built using Qt. The app allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The interface consists of buttons for digits and operators, and an input/output field for entering and evaluating expressions. It also supports decimal input and handles invalid expressions gracefully. Additionally, it saves the calculation history to a text file.

## Purpose

The purpose of creating this application is to practice fundamental C++ programming concepts such as variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and use of the STL. This project also provided an opportunity to learn Qt for GUI development and implement file handling features in C++. It serves as a foundation for building more complex desktop applications in the future.
